Caleb: Worked on index.js for your mountains. Got the query to work for displaying the information we wanted to. 

Grace: Finished the Read.Me, started the report and created the outline for everyone to work on it, lab 13 in entire part as it didn't work in Caleb's and mine barely worked, did the delete user functionality on nav bar, did messages for login, deleting profile, and register

Alex: Helped Caleb with index.js for your mountains, as well as the index.js for other options. Helped the query work correctly for both pages, as well as did the html to make it display the information in an accordian fashion.

Isabel: Worked on layout of about_us making it visually appealing and functional. Also worked on making the header/footer display correclty depending on if the user is logged in or not. Additionally worked on the profile page and the layout and how it displays the users information.
