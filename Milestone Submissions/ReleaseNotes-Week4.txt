Progress since last meeting: 

Whole index.js got up and working 

Pages have a lot of Indepth code and structure is down for them 

Started on css 

In summary: structure of what we needs is there, it would just be minor details 

On how to get two queries and get two variables from them: 
USE DB.TASK(), Reference lab 7
