# Colorado Powder Pro

## Brief Application description
Our app will show mountains in Colorado organized by the IKON and EPIC passes. Users can toggle the details of a mountain to see if it's a good fit for them by using the dropdown menu on either the "Your Mountains" or "Other Options" tab. Each mountain has details about its runs, difficulty, and elevation. Users can also change their skill level and pass on their "Profile" pages to update the "Your Mountains" page to show what the user can go on. This way as the user develops skills, it will show more runs that the user can try. There is also an "About Us" page to allow users to read about our website and the creators to have a deeper understanding of what our wesbsite is used for.
