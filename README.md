# Colorado Powder Pro

## Brief Application description
Our app will show mountains in Colorado organized by the ICON and EPIC passes. Users can toggle the details of a mountain to see if it's a good fit for them by using the dropdown menu on either the "Your Mountains" or "Other Options" tab. Each mountain has details about its runs, difficulty, elevation, and lift accesses. Users can also see, write, and edit reviews on the "Reviews" page to see what others think of the slopes.
